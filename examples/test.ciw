AB New field sampling of classic Ibexian sections in the Great Basin has
   resulted in the discovery of several new species assignable to the
   pliomerid trilobite genus Protopliomerella Harrington, 1957. The genus
   was originally monotypic and based on Protopliomerops contracta Ross,
   1951. Protopliomerella pauca Demeter, 1973, was later added, but it is
   shown herein to be a junior subjective synonym of P. contracta. The
   material originally assigned to Protopliomerella contracta by Ross
   belongs to as many as three distinct, stratigraphically separate
   species. New species include P. stegneri, P. bowlesi, P. kerouaci, P.
   seegeri, and P. okeeffeae. Two additional new species are not well
   enough known to name and are reported in open nomenclature. The
   phylogenetic status of Protopliomerella, as thus conceived, is ambiguous
   and the taxon may be rendered paraphyletic by the genera Pseudocybele
   Ross, 1951, and Lemureops McAdams and Adrain, 2009.

AB This catalogue of cancellarioidean taxa is composed of three sections.
   The first lists alphabetically 124 genus-group taxa originally proposed
   or later included within the superfamily as well as 24 misspelled or
   nude names. The second section lists alphabetically 1,864 species-group
   names proposed in or subsequently referred to genera now considered to
   belong in Cancellarioidea. Also listed are 392 nude names, misspellings
   and incorrect attributions. The third section consists of a bibliography
   of works referred to in this paper.

AB The neotropical weevil genus Embates Chevrolat is revised. New synonyms
   of Embates are Drepanambates Jekel, Batames Casey, Macrambates Casey and
   Cholinambates Casey. Information is provided about the morphology of the
   immature stages, life history, sexual dimorphism and morphological
   variability. A total of 69 species is recognized in Middle America, 38
   of which are newly described here: E. aequiperabilis, E. aliquantulus,
   E. bicoctura, E. burgeri, E. callifer, E. chelys, E. clandestinus, E.
   consimilis, E. cordiger, E. crinipes, E. discissus, E. discordabilis, E.
   euchasma, E. euscheme, E. flavoplagiatus, E. galbinus, E. gilvopictus,
   E. gracilis, E. intermedius, E. kunicus, E. maculifer, E. marchionis, E.
   mendax, E. oculifer, E. paludicola, E. paucilimbatus, E. pauhans, E.
   peperomiae, E. politus, E. pseudobumbraticus, E. pullus, E. rutilus, E.
   sagittifolicus, E. scambus, E. subulirostris, E. terrabanicus, E.
   todillofasciatus and E. uniformis. Six new subspecies are described: E.
   polymorphus altrimsecus, E. polymorphus dotensis, E. polymorphus
   fortunensis, E. polymorphus tabulensis, E. polymorphus zeledonensis and
   E. leucopleura discolor. New combinations are E. belti (Champion), E.
   leucopleura (Champion) and E. flavolimbatus (Voss) [all from
   Drepanambates]. New synonyms are E. belti [= E. triangularis
   (Champion)], E. fasciolatus (Chevrolat) [= E. sexpunctatus (Champion)]
   and E. solani (Champion) [= E. divisus (Casey)]. Embates rugosus
   (Hustache) is distinguished from E. solani and resurrected as a valid
   species. New records for Middle America are E. flavolimbatus (Voss), E.
   justini (Chevrolat) and E. rugosus. Descriptions, line drawings of
   habitus and male genitalia, geographic distributions, plant associations
   and keys for identification are provided.
